Plugin to 
== Description ==
This plugin simply moves the Plugin admin menu items down and makes 'Available Updates' the primary link. This is very useful if you have a lot of sites needing plugin updates, as it saves 3 mouse clicks per site. It adds up! If there are no plugin updates pending then clicking on the menu item just takes you to the list of installed plugins.

== Installation ==
Use WordPress' Add New Plugin feature, searching "Available Updates", or download the archive and:
1. Unzip the archive on your computer
2. Upload `available-updates` directory to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. New menu item should appear under 'Plugins' menu at the first level
== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Why? =
After about 20 websites all needing to be checked for updates on a regular basis, I was tired of so many mouse clicks and since this seemed to be a more common admin task it made sense that it should be top most on the menu system if there were updates to be done. So here you are, saving about 3 mouse clicks per WordPress install. 
You're welcome!
== Screenshots ==
1. The typical way to get to the 'Update Available' adminmenu option
2. The existing menu is pushed down and now "Avilable Updates" is top most
